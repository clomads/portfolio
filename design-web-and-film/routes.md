## History

The team at Silkroute originally set out to build Routes as a hybrid mobile application on top of the PhoneGap framework. Our team has had vast experience with building interfaces with web technologies, but never before a game that could require higher framerates. After much testing, it was determined that building Routes native would be the way to go.

Inspired by the golden ages view of the future, I took a flat design approach with a twist in the initial concepts that were originally destined for a hybrid application. The photography is directly from NASA and the typography was researched heavily and licensed from Creative Market. I experimented with various design elements for this version, but felt very comfortable with the stained white color on top of the imagery.
