`2015-2017 - UX/UI Designer & Web Developer`

AlphaStreet is possibly the largest project I've been involved in. While it's original form was as a social stock trading site, it currently lives on as a data and analysis provider. Staring from their mockups, I orchestrated all branding and UI design while also implementing HTML/CSS for the website. The app came after a second major revision to the design language that helped better convey the vast amount of data we were working with.
