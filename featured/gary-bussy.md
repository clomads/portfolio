# Gary Bussy

## Summary

Gary Bussy is the converted shorty school bus I live and work out of. I purchased her in July of 2020 and it has been an evolving project over the years and has many years of plans to go. I've used it as a platform to learn more about lithium batteries, solar, and DIY home automation with Home Assistant.&#x20;

I'm working on a whole separate wiki to track the projects I do in her. I will link it here when it's ready.
