`2013 - Director/Animator/Designer/Editor`

Silkroute had a very large set of visual assets to represent the company's presence amongst myriad markets. Some were created or obtained before I came on board and I filled in the gaps as I refreshed how it all came together.&#x20;

Having such a vast visual library allowed me a great opportunity to animate an engaging introduction video for sharing with potential clients and partners. Motion graphics were processed in After Effects from vector images made in Illustrator.&#x20;
