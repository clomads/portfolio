# App Concepts

## SkyPulse

SkyPulse was an extension of popular polling app Show of Hands. It was to be a white-label version for companies to get market feedback directly from their consumer base. Considering that it was more useful to use the existing Show of Hands user base and field paid placements, SkyPulse pivoted to being the platform implemented for advertisers. I was hoping some of these design elements would trickle back into the main application, but priorities changed.
