# Gary Bussy

Gary Bussy is the shorty school bus that I live in. It is based on a 1995 Chevy G30 cutaway van with a 6.5L Detroit Diesel. I've progressively improved the interior amenities since I bought it in the summer of 2020 when I also moved into it from the van I lived in prior.

As with everything I work on I am working to open source all the work I've been doing on Gary including a whole wiki dedicated to it. With everything else I'm working on, it's a bit on the backburner, but I think there's some stuff on my github. It's an extremely large project including wiring, framing, plumbing, engine repair, painting, etc which also has kept me back from fully documenting everything yet, but I'm trying my best.
