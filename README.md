Hi Friends,

I'm Chloe Madison-Ryan, a visual artist and open hardware designer in ~~the Bay Area~~ Joshua Tree who lives in a shorty school bus. I do my best to document that work across various corners of the internet, and my current focus is [VDBX.io](https://www.vdbx.io) where certain designs of mine are more formally documented, open-sourced, and made available for purchase.&#x20;

This site is for everything else. I have done so many things in my life, I figured having a living portfolio in wiki form will probably make things easier for me to archive it all. Otherwise it'll just be in a random folder waiting for a data catastrophe to wipe it out... ask me how I know.

Skills I have excelled at throughout my life:

* Concept design for digital & physical interactive creations
* Product design & optimization for web & mobile
* Logo & branding design with product integration
* HTML5 & CSS3 w/ SASS
* Video production with DSLR & Mirrorless
* Live event video production: live switching & system design/integration
* Video editing, 2D compositing, & animation
* Lithium battery systems for solar off-grid applications
  * Automation, data collection, & user presentation

This may also be a place for me to write out concepts and prototype documentation for things that may never exist. It'll also be a repository for actual designs I'd like to share under my name vs being a [VDBX](https://www.vdbx.io/) product.&#x20;

Love,

Chloe Madison-Ryan
