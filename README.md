# Welcome

Hi Friends,

I'm Chloe Madison-Ryan, an artist in the Bay Area who lives in a shorty school bus and designs electronics hardware for DIYers.

I have done so many things in my life though, so having a living portfolio in wiki form will probably make things easier for me to archive work. Otherwise it'll just be chillin in a random folder waiting for a data catastrophe to wipe it out... ask me how I know.

This may also be a place for me to write out concepts and prototype documentation for things that may never exist. It'll also be a repository for actual designs I'd like to share under my name vs being a VDBX product.&#x20;

Love,

@clomads&#x20;

Chloe Madison-Ryan
